# Test Case Definitions
# This file defines the test specification for a product feature.
# Both Dev (02_dev) and QA (03_qa) maintain their own copy of this file.
#
# Dev tests focus on: unit tests, service layer tests, API route tests
# QA tests focus on: integration tests, end-to-end tests, user flow tests
#
# Each top-level key is a functional area (e.g., signup, listing, generation).
# Under each area, list individual test cases.
#
# Required fields per test:
#   name        - Short descriptive name of the test
#   type        - One of: unit test, api test, integration test, e2e test
#   status      - One of: created, in_progress, completed
#
# Optional fields:
#   input       - Test input data
#   output      - Expected output or assertion
#   endpoint    - API endpoint (for api/integration tests)
#   method      - HTTP method (for api/integration tests)
#   reference   - File path and line range for the test implementation
#   setup       - Preconditions or test data setup
#   tags        - Labels for categorization (e.g., smoke, regression, happy-path)
#
# Status values:
#   created     - Test case defined, not yet implemented
#   in_progress - Test being written or debugged
#   completed   - Test implemented and passing
