# Feature Ticket Definitions
# This file serves as the structured feature backlog for a product feature.
# It replaces traditional ticket systems (e.g., Jira) with an AI-readable,
# version-controlled format that lives in the codebase.
#
# Each top-level key is a functional area (e.g., signup, listing, generation).
# Under each area, list individual feature tickets.
#
# Required fields per feature:
#   name        - Short descriptive name of the feature
#   type        - One of: ui feature, api feature, security feature, middleware feature, ai feature
#   status      - One of: created, in_progress, completed
#
# Optional fields (vary by type):
#   fields      - Form fields (for ui features)
#   validation  - Validation rules (for ui/api features)
#   input       - Input contract (for api features)
#   output      - Output contract (for api features)
#   errors      - Error codes (for api features)
#   endpoint    - API route (for api features)
#   algorithm   - Algorithm used (for security features)
#   protected   - Protected routes (for middleware features)
#   public      - Public routes (for middleware features)
#   model       - AI model used (for ai features)
#   prompt      - Prompt strategy (for ai features)
#
# Status values:
#   created     - Ticket defined, not started
#   in_progress - Currently being implemented
#   completed   - Implemented and verified
